## Dear Tumblr Talent Acquistion,

To be brief, I would absolutely adore a position at Tumblr. What I can offer Tumblr is 3 years of data science experience (both full and part-time), a large portfolio of work in applied statistics and statistical learning, and best practices analytical software development. But above any of my technical qualifications is a compelling love and excitement of solutions to problems. I come from a low-SES background, having no exterior support financially. I recieved scholarships in Undergrad, as well as practicum and assistantships through State Farm and the University of Illinois throughout my Masters Degree. Frankly, landing a job at Tumblr would be a great milestone in my personal story, and would prove (at least to myself) that hard work and determination does truly pay off in the end.

Thank you for reviewing my application. My resume has also been submitted for your review.

Best,
Kyle N. Payne

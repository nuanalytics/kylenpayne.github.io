  <h2 id="dear-spotify-talent-acquistion">Dear Spotify Talent Acquistion,</h2>

<p>To be brief, I would absolutely adore a position at Spotify. What I can offer Spotify is 3 years of data science experience (both full and part-time), a large portfolio of work in applied statistics and statistical learning, and best practices analytical software development. But above any of my technical qualifications is a compelling love and excitement of music (I was a very amateur electronic music producer in my teenage years). I come from a low-SES background, having no exterior support financially. I recieved scholarships in Undergrad, as well as practicum and assistantships through State Farm and the University of Illinois throughout my Masters Degree. Frankly, landing a job at Spotify would be a great milestone in my personal story, and would prove (at least to myself) that hard work and determination does truly pay off in the end.</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing my application. My resume has also been submitted for your review.</p>

<p>Best,
Kyle N. Payne</p>

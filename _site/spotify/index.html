  <h2 id="dear-alexandra-scheiman-or-the-other-hiring-professionals-that-were-more-difficult-to-look-up-on-linkedin">Dear Alexandra Scheiman or the other hiring professional(s) that were more difficult to look up on linkedin,</h2>

<p>Instead of a typical cover letter (considering this is an analyst position), I figured I would provide a set of summary statistics of my qualifications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1.75 Degrees: 1 BS, 1 MS (to be completed in Spring 2015), both in Statistics</li>
  <li>2 Intern/Contract Positions working with huge datasets (including data that are high dimensional (i.e. genomic expression data))</li>
  <li>Programming Proficiency in 3 languages (R, Python, C++, Including Pandas)</li>
  <li>10+ Github Repositories</li>
  <li>100+ hours in research/consulting experience</li>
  <li>2 semesters of teaching applied statistics courses</li>
  <li>19,000 Minutes of Spotify usage in 2015</li>
</ol>

<p>What I can offer Spotify is 2 years of data science experience (both full and part-time), a large portfolio of work in applied statistics and statistical learning, and best practices analytical software development. But above any of my technical qualifications is a compelling love and excitement of music (I was a very amateur electronic music producer in my teenage years). I come from a low-SES background, having no exterior support financially. I recieved scholarships in Undergrad, as well as practicum and assistantships through State Farm and the University of Illinois throughout my Masters Degree. Frankly, landing a job at Spotify would be a great milestone in my personal story, and would prove (at least to myself) that hard work and determination does truly pay off in the end.</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing my application. My resume has also been submitted for your review.</p>

<p>Best,
Kyle N*. Payne</p>

<ul>
  <li>I put an N. on everything because if you google ‘Kyle Payne’, you’ll get someone else… I’m not that guy.</li>
</ul>

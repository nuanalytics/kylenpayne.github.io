# Homework
1. Please turn in your homework each Tuesday at Lecture.
2. Your work is legible. If not, I will have to assign a grade a 0.
3. All corresponding work is shown.
4. By Hand is not strictly defined for my section. If you want to solve a particular problem in R, instead of doing all calculations 
explicitly by hand, that is fine, but you must show your work/code/output.
5. Computational work, that is, any result that has been computing using the statistical software used in this course is
excepted up to the upper bound of the relative error of the computation. (Or possibly different answers if you supply your code).


# Lab Rules
6. Please don't be late. If you are late, please don't interrupt the lab session.
7. I reserve the right to kick disruptive students out of the lab (Thankful I haven't had to exercise this right). This includes if you are sleeping,
if you sleep during the lab session, I will kick you out for the day (including the quiz).
8. Lab sections are not intended to be a replacement for lecture. Therefore, if you miss several lectures worth of material, please
note that it is your responsibility to get caught up on your own. The TAs cannot possibly give individualized attention to students 
outside of office hours (Although I will try my best to answer questions within reason).
9. Please allow up to 24hrs for any email response, except on the weekends, as I will not answer any student emails on the Weekends.
10. When emailing, please make the subject 'cpsc440', this is the filter on my email to ensure I get student emails. If you don't put this
as the subject, I may see your email and I may not.

# Lab Format

11. The labs will regularly consist of a short lecture or discussion of topics, an activity, and the last 30mins will be reserved for the quiz.
12. The activities given out during the lab section will typically follow a mixture of computational tools, lecture material, quiz and homework material.
The activities are constructed to be relevant to the current HW due by the next week, and therefore is a useful tool for understanding the material.
13. Occasionally, we will diverge the discussion to special topics of interest, but I promise that these will only be done to establish greater understanding
of the course material.
14. The degree that you participate in the lab discussions is up to you, but please don't be outwardly disrespectful in your lack of participation or (7,8) go into effect.
15. Homeworks and quizzes will be handed back each week at the start of the lab session. If you have any grade disputes, please email me within 1 week and we will address the discrepency at the next lab session.
16. If you need to miss a lab session, please email me (see 10), to schedule a time for a make-up. Make-ups will be given at my discretion according to my available time each week. (Read: Try to avoid missing quizzes towards the busy times of the semester.)

# Getting Help

17. If you find yourself in peril with this course at any point of the semester, please reach out to us. Please don't wait until the end of the semester to reach out to us, as we then only have a limited set of things we can do.

18. There are a multitude of resource that you can use to get help with course materials, these are listed in the Resources section of the course compass page.

##Thanks,

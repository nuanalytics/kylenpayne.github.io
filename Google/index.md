title: Google Cover Letter

## Dear Google Recruiters!,

Instead of a typical cover letter (considering this is a Quantitative Analyst Intern Position), I figured I would provide a set of summary statistics of my qualifications:

1. 1.75 Degrees: 1 BS, 1 MS (to be completed in Spring 2015), both in Statistics
2. 2 Intern/Contract Positions working with huge datasets (including data that are high dimensional (i.e. genomic expression data))
3. Programming Proficiency in 3 languages (R, Python, C++, Including Pandas)
4. 10+ Github Repositories
5. 100+ hours in research/consulting experience
6. 2 semesters of teaching applied statistics courses
7. 7 is a lucky number to end a list on

What I can offer Google as an intern is 2 years of data science experience (both full and part-time), a large portfolio of work in applied statistics and statistical learning, and best practices analytical software development. But above any of my technical qualifications is a compelling need to learn!

I come from a low-SES background, having no exterior support financially. I received scholarships in Undergrad, as well as practicum and assistantships through State Farm and the University of Illinois throughout my Masters Degree. Frankly, landing an internship with Google would be a great milestone in my personal story, and would prove (at least to myself) that hard work and determination does truly pay off in the end.


Thank you for reviewing my application. My resume has also been submitted for your review.

Best,
Kyle N*. Payne

* I put an N. on everything because if you google 'Kyle Payne', you'll get someone else... I'm not that guy.
